We met in the engineering wing to finalize our project and create the presentation from 11 to 12:30. Ironed out the remaining flaws that was preventing the site from being hosted on
render as well as completing the review function for each Mountain. Created drop down menus for each of the Mountains too. Found and fixed bugs for the site. 
We spoke about what we wanted to do for our presentation on thursday.
